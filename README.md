#### By Olivia Hinton & Cory Olson | July 21, 2016

## Description
An app that allows users to keep track of recipes.

* As a user, I can add a recipe with ingredients and instructions, so I remember how to prepare my favorite dishes.
* As a user, I can tag my recipes with different categories, so recipes are easier to find. A recipe can have many tags and a tag can have many recipes.
* As a user, I can update and delete tags, so I can have flexibility with how I categorize recipes.
* As a user, I can edit my recipes, so I can make improvements or corrections to my recipes.
* As a user, I can delete recipes I don't like or use, so I don't have to see them as choices.
* As a user, I can rate my recipes, so I know which ones are the best.
* As a user, I can list my recipes by highest rated so I can see which ones I like the best.
* As a user, I can see all recipes that use a certain ingredient, so I can more easily find recipes for the ingredients I have.
